## 🔒 Best Practices for Secure Local Interception

When analyzing application traffic in a local sandbox or emulator, you should follow standard safety guidelines to avoid compromising your testing environment:

1. **Use Isolated Environments:** Always perform traffic interception in a dedicated Android emulator or a separate test device. Do not use your personal, daily-driver device.
2. **Use Test Accounts:** Never use active personal accounts. Create and use dedicated test accounts to prevent potential session hijacking or account flags.
3. **Manage Trusted Credentials:** After completing your traffic analysis, immediately remove any custom Root CA certificates installed on the device's trust store to prevent potential interception by unauthorized networks in the future.
